# Agents

This document describes the AI agents and coding guidelines for contributors and automated agents working on the Phonematic project.

## Application Purpose

Phonematic is a desktop application for creating exportable AI voice models that replicate the prosody of a specific human voice.

### Core Workflow

1. **Model management** — The user creates a new empty voice model or imports an existing model file (`.phonematic` format).
2. **Training input** — The user imports two paired files: a plain-text transcript and an audio recording of a human voice reading that exact transcript.
3. **Model training** — The application analyses the recording against the transcript to learn the speaker's full prosody — pitch contour, timing, stress, rhythm, and intonation — and incorporates that information into the model.
4. **Export** — The trained model can be exported so it can be shared, archived, or loaded into other tools.
5. **PhoScript output** — The model produces a PhoScript file (`.phos`) that encodes every spoken word together with its complete prosodic annotation, ready for use by downstream synthesis or analysis pipelines.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Voice model | A trained artefact that captures the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of a single speaker |
| Prosody | The suprasegmental features of speech: pitch, loudness, duration, rhythm, and intonation |
| PhoScript | The application's native output format; a structured representation of spoken text with full prosodic markup |
| Training pair | A matched (transcript text file, audio recording) pair used to train or refine a voice model |

## General Guidelines

- Follow existing code style and conventions found throughout the codebase.
- Target **.NET 10** for all projects unless otherwise specified.
- Make minimal changes to achieve the goal; avoid unnecessary refactoring.
- Do not add comments unless they match existing comment style or explain complex logic.
- Use existing libraries whenever possible; avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- Validate all changes by building the solution and running relevant tests before considering a task complete.

- Source code lives under the solution root at `C:\Users\david.pizon\source\repos\Phonematic\`.
- Documentation lives in the `/docs` folder.

## Coding Standards

- Use idiomatic C# and follow the conventions already present in the file being edited.
- Prefer `async`/`await` for asynchronous code.
- Use `CancellationToken` parameters (named `ct`) on all async public methods.
- Use `IProgress<double>` for long-running operations that report percentage (0.0–1.0).
- Interfaces live alongside their implementations in `Services/` — name them `I<ServiceName>`.
- ViewModels use `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]` from CommunityToolkit.Mvvm; avoid manual `INotifyPropertyChanged` boilerplate.
- Services that hold unmanaged resources (ONNX sessions, LLaMA models, Whisper processors) must implement `IDisposable`.
- Keep pull requests focused and scoped to a single concern.

## Dependency Injection

All services are registered in `App.axaml.cs → ConfigureServices`. Follow these lifetime rules:

| Lifetime | Used for |
|---|---|
| `Singleton` | `IConfigService`, `IModelManagerService`, `TokenListenerService`, `IPlaudApiService`, all ViewModels |
| `Transient` | `IFileTrackingService` |
| `Scoped / Factory` | `PhonematicDbContext` (via `AddDbContextFactory`) |

## Adding a New Service

1. Define `IMyService` in `Services/IMyService.cs`.
2. Implement `MyService : IMyService` in `Services/MyService.cs`.
3. Register in `App.axaml.cs → ConfigureServices`.
4. Add unit tests in `tests/Phonematic.Tests/`.

## Adding a New View

1. Create the AXAML + code-behind pair in `Views/`.
2. Create a matching ViewModel in `ViewModels/` that extends `ViewModelBase`.
3. Wire the ViewModel as a property on `MainWindowViewModel` and register it in DI.

## Testing

- Run all relevant tests after making changes to verify nothing is broken.
- Add tests for new functionality where appropriate.
- Tests that require model files or real I/O should be skipped or use temp files.
- `ChunkTextTests` demonstrates the "testable subclass" pattern for services that don't need model dependencies in every test path.

## Branching

- The default branch is `main`.
- Feature work should be done on a dedicated branch and submitted via pull request.
